					width="500" 
					height="500" 
					alig="middle"
					/>

				  <img 
				  src="./pams/white_brinstock.jpg" 
				  alt="male pams" 
				  width="500" 
				  height="500" 
				  img-alig="middle"
				  />

				</ul>
				
				<ul>
				  
				  <li>The <b>Female Cross Design</b></li>
				   <li>The <b>Female Hermes Design</b></li>

                  <img 
				  src="./pams/hermes_design.jpg" 
				  alt="female pams" 
				  width="700" 
				  height="600" 
				  img-align="middle" 
				  />

				   <li>The <b> Female Triangle Design</b></li>
				   <li>The <b>Female Heel Design</b></li>
				   <li><i><b>And many others that are not included.</b></i></li>
				</ul>
				
				   <p>There are still many more types of footwears styles for both the male and female gender but these footwears, 
				      are still classified into:</p>
				
				<ul>
				   
				   <li><i><b>The Nora Floor Made Designs</b></i></li>
				   <li><i><b>The Nora Sole Made Designs</b></i></li>
				   <li><i><b>The Maco Floor Made Designs</b></i></li>
				   <li><i><b>And so on.</b></i></li>
				
				</ul>
				    <p>An example of a <b>Nora Floor footwears</b> is shown below:</p>
				
					<img 
					src="./pams/female_triangle.jpg" 
					alt="nora pams" 
					width="700" 
					height="500"
					alig="center"
					/>
					
					<p>This is a female gender <b>Triangle Nora Floor Design</b>.
					   In terms of price, <b>The Nora Floor Design</b> 
					   can be gotten in a cheaper rate than that of the <b>The Maco Design.</b>
					<b>The Nora Floor Design</b> can't be exposed to too much sunshine to prevent the <b>Nora</b> from spoling.
					</p>
					<p>Next is going to be an example of a <b>Maco Floor Design</b> which is shown below</p>
				
					<img 
					src="./pams/IMG-20220120-WA0026.jpg" 
					alt="female pams" 
					width="700" 
					height="700" 
					alig="middle"
					/>
					
					<p>The one above is an example of a female gender <b>Hermes Maco Floor Design Pams.</b> In terms of price, <b> 
					   The Hermes Maco Floor Design Pams</b> is always more expensive than that of <b>The Nora Floor Design
				    </b> and always lasts longer than that of <b>The Nora Floor Design.</b> 
					   Unlike <b>The Nora Floor Design</b> <b>The Maco Floor Design</b> can be worn anytime even under a heavy 
				       and still stay strong</p>
			         
					<p>Next will be the <b><i>Male Cross OR X Pams which is shown below:</i></b></p>
			
					<img
					src="./pams/x_design.png"
					alt="Cross Pams"
					width="700"
					height="500"
					/>

					<p>Now i will be showing you different types of pams for femamle genders only.</p>
					<p>Here, you will see different tpyes of cover pams that can be worn only by the <i>Female Gender.</i></p>

			       <img
				   src="./pams/white_design.png"
				   alt="Female gender"
                   width="700"
                   height="600"
	               alig="left"
				   />

				   <p>Now it's time to show you an example of a <b>Male Cover Pams</b> and it is shown below:</p>

                   <img
				   src="./pams/cover.png"
				   alt="male cover pams"
			       width="700"           
                   height="600"
                   alig="middle" 
				   />

				   <p>Next, i will be showing you a perfect Male Hermes Pams made with the maco Floor Design</p>
                   
				   <p>It is shown below:</p>

				   <img
				   src="./pams/male_hermes.png"
				   alt="male cover pams"
			       width="800"           
                   height="500"
                   alig img="middle" 
				   />

				   <p>Other female design like the following:</p>

				   <img
				   src="./pams/red_design.png"
				   alt="male cover pams"
			       width="500"           
                   height="500"
                   alig img="middle" 
				   />
                   
				   <img
				   src="./pams/female.png"
				   alt="male cover pams"
			       width="500"           
                   height="500"
                   alig img="middle" 
				   />

				   <p>In terms of price, this ones are very much more expensive than the Nora and Maco design. As you
				      can see in the picture that the are still being made with the normal materials like the Nora floor but still,
				      there are still more expensive than that of the Hermes design depending on what the hermes design is made with.
				   </p>

				   <p>Next will be some other designs worn by the male gender:</p>

				   <img
				   src="./pams/elderly.png"
				   alt="male cover pams"
			       width="600"           
                   height="600"
                   alig img="middle" 
				   />

				   <p>This one is also an example of a Maco Floor Design but for men. Not that young boys can't wear it 
				      but looking at the pams alone, you will notice that it looks more matured than the next picture which is
				      shown below: 
				   </p>

				   <img
				   src="./pams/cover_pams.png"
				   alt="male cover pams"
			       width="700"           
                   height="600"
                   alig img="middle" 
				   />

				   <p>This is another type of a Cover Pams Design for both the male and female gender but there are mostly worn
				      by the male gender because it is more suited for them and it is the most expensive from the ones that we have
				      seen so far. From the first picture to this to the last, this nice looking cover pams is the most expensive
				      cover pams design that i have shown you so far but as we continue we are going to see more beautiful and nice 
				      looking different designs and even more on the ones that we have seen already.   </p>
